 The temperature analysis in this repository involved querying the dataset using SQL queries and SQLAlchemy to extract relevant temperature data. Summary statistics, including minimum, maximum, and average temperatures, were calculated to understand the temperature distribution and variations. The analysis also identified the most active stations based on observation counts and visualized temperature trends using histograms. While the analysis primarily focused on temperature data, it could provide insights that may be relevant to assessing the sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop business throughout the year.
